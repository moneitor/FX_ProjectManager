## FX Personal Project Manager

Hi there.

With the goal of learning and getting better at python, and maybe along the way creating something that might help me out with the structure of my personal 
projects in the future, I decided to slowly create a set of tools that kind of work like a simple vfx pipeline for personal projects.

This is still work in progress and will remain like that for the long term.
